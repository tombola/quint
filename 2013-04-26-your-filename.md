# A simple method of note taking

possible approach:

*  un-lined notebooks
*  conventions for page numbers, titles etc
*  highlight book while reading with different colour page markers
*  second read to write down quotes/insights (notebook or app)
*  mindmap for structure

**ideas**

*  simple live/submit conversion of simple notes to hierarchy linked to book (use zotero?) and author
*  markdown equivalent for notetaking - eg:

```
# The book title
## chapter
pp42 

* The cat lay on the mat : interesting use of 'cat'
[ author seems to be sure of himself

```

**options**

*  brutally simple ruby note > html
*  all client-side javascript, create json or other re-usable format to save*
*  drupal feeds (zotero), biblio [book?] and ratings and parse notes on submit (or live update by js on line break?)
*  integrate simple ruby authoring tool with drupal via services?
